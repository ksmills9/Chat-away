# Chat-away

This app is a socket.io based chat room application.

Running the application allows multiple users to log in at the same url, and chat with multiple people in the chatroom. Login and chat away!

P.s. there are also a couple other commands when entered in chat. '/nick <newName>' changes your username. And '/nickcolor <AABBCC>' changes your username color.

Running instructions:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the ‘chat-app’ folder
3. Run ‘node index.js’
4. The terminal will show ‘listening at *:3000’ and the app is available at ‘localhost:3000’
